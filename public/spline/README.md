# Spline 3D Robot Integration

## âœ… Current Status
The 3D cursor-following robot has been successfully integrated! The robot will now:
- Follow your cursor movements
- React to form focus states
- Provide interactive feedback during form filling

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented
- **Cursor Tracking**: Robot follows mouse movements in real-time
- **Form Interaction**: Robot responds when the contact form is focused
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid robot movements and rotations
- **Fallback System**: Graceful fallback if 3D scene fails to load
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details
- **Scene File**: `/spline/scene.splinecode` (974KB - your actual robot)
- **Integration**: Full Spline React integration with cursor tracking
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth interactions
- **Security**: No external dependencies, all local files

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
1. **Cursor Movement**: Robot head/eyes follow your mouse cursor
2. **Form Focus**: Robot pays attention when you click on form fields
3. **Interactive Feedback**: Visual responses to user actions
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Natural robot movements and animations

## ðŸš€ Current Implementation
The robot component now includes:
- Real-time cursor tracking
- Form state detection
- Interactive animations
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Performance optimizations

Your cursor-following robot is now fully functional! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
