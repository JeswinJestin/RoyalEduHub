   const NOTIFICATION_EMAIL = 'your-email@example.com'; // Your email address
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Setup

1. In Google Apps Script, click **"Run"** and select `testSetup`
2. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

4. Click **"Deploy"**
5. Copy the **Web app URL** (you'll need this for the React app)

### Step 6: Update React Application

// Add this constant at the top
const GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE';

export const submitToGoogleAppsScript = async (formData) => {
  try {
    console.log('üöÄ Submitting to Google Apps Script...');
    
    const response = await fetch(GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('‚úÖ Google Apps Script submission successful');
      return {
        success: true,
        message: 'Form submitted successfully via Google Apps Script',
        method: 'google_apps_script',
        data: result
      };

    throw error;
  }
};

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Script function not found" error**
   - Make sure you've saved the script after pasting the code
   - Verify the function names match exactly

2. **"Permission denied" error**
   - Run the `testSetup` function first to grant permissions
   - Make sure you're signed in to the correct Google account

3. **"Spreadsheet not found" error**
   - Double-check the SHEET_ID in your script
   - Ensure the spreadsheet is accessible by your Google account

   - Ensure Gmail API is enabled (usually automatic)
